# Equation Driven Surface 
This is a Fusion 360 add-in that allows the creation of equation driven surfaces. This can be used to 3D print three-dimensional equations such as those frequently analyzed in a multi-variable calculus course.

It is published on the Fusion 360 app store:

## Fusion 360 App Store Description
This add-in plots surfaces specified by equations of the form z = f(x,y). This is done by sketching slices of the graph at various x values and then lofting them together.

In addition to plotting surfaces, this add-in can also create a solid body with a flat base whose surface takes the form specified.
